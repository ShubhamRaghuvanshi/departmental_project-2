# departmental_project-2
The code uses MADGRAPH to simulate the tree level Feynman diagrams for the process pp -> ttZ' -> tttt,  and Pythia to
generate the corresponding standard model QCD background. FastJet and SoftJet are used for jet reconstruction. 
Top quarks are tagged using HepTopTagger, and ROOT-CERN is used for data analysis.

The code can be run simply using the makefile.
The Detailed report for the project is provided in the pdf file 'p2Report.pdf'.
