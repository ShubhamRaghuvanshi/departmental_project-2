# departmental_project-2
The code uses MADGRAPH simulate the process pp -> ttZ' -> tttt in the Leading Order(LO) and Pythia to
generate the corresponding standard model QCD background. FatJet and SoftJet are used for jet reconstruction. 
Top quarks are tagged using HepTopTagger, and ROOT-CERN is used for data analysis.
