\section{Introduction}


The hypothetical $Z^\prime$ boson is required by many extensions of the Standard Model \cite{paul,zpdg}, simplest of these models are U(1) extension of SM which require an additional massive vector boson which couples to standard model fermions. It is electrically-neutral, color singlet spin 1 particle. The mass of $Z^\prime$ in principle depends upon it's coupling to various SM and BSM particles, which are model dependant. Therefore apart from discovering $Z^\prime$ is also to be identified with the correct model.

In this work we analyse events in which $Z^\prime$ is produced in pp collision at $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV in assosiation with top anti-top pair \ref{fynnmann}. We chose B-L model \cite{bl} for this study since it is one of the simplest U(1) extensions of the SM. However the methods used for analysis are fairly general. Using MSTW2008lo68cl\_nf3 \cite{pdfsets} parton distribution functions(PDF), with $M_{Z^\prime} = 1$ TeV and $M_t = 172$ GeV, $ \text{MADGRAPH}_5$aMC@NLO \cite{mad1,mad2} provides the cross section for this process to be $ \sigma_{B-L}( p p \to Z^\prime t \bar{t}) = 0.000183 \pm 1.3905 \times 10^{-6}$(stat) pb. In this analysis we will be interested mainly in the $Z^\prime \to t \bar{t}$ decay channel, the final state therefore contains 4 top quarks with the BL cross section of $ \sigma_{B-L}(pp \to Z^\prime t \bar{t} \to t \bar{t}t \bar{t}) = 9.877 \times 10^{-8} \pm  1.5 \times 10^{-10}$ pb. The most dominant background for this is 4 top QCD background with the SM cross section of $\sigma_{SM}(pp \to t \bar{t}t \bar{t}) = 0.01182 \pm 3.19 \times 10^{-5}$ pb.

\section{ $Z^\prime$ phenomenonology and current mass constraints }


 $Z^\prime$ boson is predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model (SM). Each with different coupling to the SM fermions. In general generation-dependant couplings of $Z^\prime$ to the SM fermions is given by 
 
 \begin{equation}
	 Z_\mu^\prime \left[ \sum_{i=1,j=1}^{i=3,j=3} \left(g_f^L \right)_{ij} \bar{f}_L^i \gamma^\mu f_L^j + \left(g_f^R \right)_{ij} \bar{f}_R^i \gamma^\mu f_R^j	  \right]
 \end{equation} 
 
 where the indices i and j run over all three generations and f = (u, d, e, $\nu$). The coefficients $\left(g_f^L \right)_{ij}$ and $\left(g_f^R \right)_{ij}$ are real dimentionless parameters, and analogous to the weak hypercharge of elecro-weak interations the gauge charges $z_{fi}^L$, $z_{fi}^R$ determine all the couplings and mass and decay width of $Z^\prime$ \cite{zphysics,zpheno2}. 
    
    
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Simple U(1) extensions of the standard model, also known as Sequential Standard Model(SSM) \cite{zpheno1}, which assumes $Z^\prime$ couplings to SM fermions to be the same as $Z^0$ but with a polemass of the order of TeV. These theories have the conserved gauge charges (as in column 1) proportional to the baryon number minus $x$ times the lepton number $(B - x L)$, and are in general known as $U(1)_{B-xL}$ extensions of the standard model \cite{zpdg}.
 	
 	\begin{figure}[h]
 		\begin{centering}	
 			\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./zpcharges.png} 
 			\caption{ Examples of generation-independant U(1) gauge charges for quarks and leptons, here $x$ is any rational number.}

 			\centering
 		\end{centering} 		
 	\end{figure}   
 	   
 	$Z^\prime$ is leptophobic for $x=0$, i.e. it only decays to quarks and the interactions preserve baryon number, for $x>>1$ it is quark-phobic. The latter possibilitiy is being ruled out by various collider physics experiments. The case where $x=1$ is particularly important, it gives $U(1)_{B-L}$,  the only anomaly-free global symmetry of the Standard Model, easily promoted to a local symmetry by introducing three right-handed neutrinos, which automatically make neutrinos massive. $B-L$ symmetry remains the only unbroken symmetry of the SM so far \cite{bl}.   	  
 	   
	\item The second column shows charges for $U(1)_{10+x5}$, these symmetry groups are part of $E_6$ Grand Unified Theories(GUT) \cite{zpheno4}. This set leads to $	Z - Z^\prime$ mass mixing close to electroweak scale. Under the third set,$U(1)_{d−xu}$, the weak-doublet quarks are neutral, and the ratio of $u_R$ and $d_R$ charges is $−x$.  For $x= 1$ this is the “right-handed” group $U(1)_R$. 	
 \end{itemize} 
   
   The existance of this $U(1)^\prime$ symmetry will have profound implications of for particle physics and cosmology. The most important implications include an extended Higgs sector, extended neutralino sector, and solution to the $\mu$ problem in supersymmetry, exotic fermions needed for anomaly cancellation, possible flavor changing neutral current effects, neutrino mass, possible $Z^\prime$ mediation of supersymmetry breaking, and cosmological implications for cold dark matter and electroweak baryogenesis \cite{paul}.     
   
\newpage  

	In general $Z^\prime$ couples to all the SM and some of the BSM particles, however the current analysis at LHC are motivated by pure SM contribution in which $Z^\prime$, couples to all the SM fermions, namely the minimal U(1) extensions of the SM. Along these lines, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have searched for $Z^\prime$ bosons by investigating dilepton and dijet final state in detail. By using dilepton data at 13 TeV, the ATLAS collaboration \cite{atlas} set the mass exclusion limits $M_{Z^\prime}>4.5$ TeV(SSM) and $M_{Z^\prime}′>3.8-4.1 $ TeV (GUT-inspired models), whereas CMS obtained $M_{Z^\prime}>4.0 $ TeV(SSM) and $M_{Z^\prime}>3.5$ TeV (GUT-inspired models) \cite{cms}.  For dijets,  the limits are much milder and read $M_{Z^\prime} > 2.1-2.9$ TeV (ATLAS) \cite{atlasjet} and $M_{Z^\prime} >2.7$ TeV (CMS) \cite{cmsjet}.
	
	The U(1) supersymmetric models however by including supersymmetric decay modes lowers the branching ratios into SM final states and impact the $Z^\prime$ mass limits by $200-300$ GeV \cite{zsusy}.

\section{Top quark reconstruction}

The phenomenology of top quark is driven by it's large mass, which also gives it very short lifetime $\sim 10^{-24}$s and makes it the only quark that decays semi-weakly into W boson and b quark. The brancing ratio for the top decay $t \to W b $ is close to unity, and for this analysis we assume it to be unity. The signature of top quarks which decay hadrnoically i.e. for which the decay $t \to W b $ is followed by $W \to q \bar{q}$ where $q = (u, d, s, c)$, is in general three quark-like jets in the final state, one of which is supposed to be b-tagged and other two W. If the parent top is at rest then these three jets are well separated from each other in $(y,\phi)$ plane and can in general be identified as thee distinct quark jets in an event. On the other hand is the parent top is boosted i.e. has high $p_T$ then the three quark jets will tend to be collinear along the direction of the parent top, and consenquently instead of having three well separated jets in final state we may get only one  fatjet. Substructure of this fatjet gives information of the corresponding decay. \ref{boost}.     

 	\begin{figure}[h]

 			\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{./topboost.png} 
 			\caption{}
 			\label{boost}
 			\centering
 		\end{centering} 		
 	\end{figure}   

To quantify things lets consider the angular separations between partons in the process $ t \to w b \to q \bar{q} b$ as a function of the $p_T^{top}$ fig:\ref{rwbt}. The angular separation in rapidity-azimuth $(y, \phi)$ plane $\left(  \Delta R = \sqrt{\Delta y^2 + \Delta \phi^2} \right)$ between the decay products  in a two-body depends on the mass and boost of the decaying particle and in the high $p_T$ approzmation it is given by .

\begin{equation}
 \Delta R \approx \frac{2m}{p_T}
\end{equation} 

Where m and $p_T$ are the mass and transverse momenta of the decaying particle. For a top $(m = 173)$ GeV \cite{pdg-top} with $p_T = 200$ GeV the separation is $\Delta R = 1.73 $, similarly for a W boson $(m = 80)$ \cite{pdg-w} with same $p_T$ the separation is $\Delta R = 0.8$ . Fig \ref{rwbt} shows the relation between $\Delta R $ and $p_T$ for the two body decays of top and w respectively. A falling trend in the angular separation as we go to higher $p_T^{top}$  is apparent, from the plot one can also see that roughly $\Delta R_{wb}^{avg} < 1.7$, and $\Delta R_{qq}^{avg}< 0.8 $ for $p_T^{top} > 200$ GeV. The top tagging algorithms that are aimed at reconstructing low $p_T$ top work on the assumption that it would show up in an event as one b-tag and two distinct w-tag jets, this assumption grows weaker as $p_T$ of the top increases and the top, instead of corresponding to three quark jets which are well separated from each other.  and tend to be collinear and merge into each oth. The effeciencies of such algorithms is also expected to be going downhill for boostred tops, for our analysis however we will be looking at the tops in the decay $Z^\prime \to t \bar{t}$, which in general may be quite boosted in laboratory frame depending upon the mass of the $Z^\prime$ fig:\ref{toppt}. Jet substructure techniques are required to reoconstruct top in such cases.

\subsection{Top tagging algorithms}

	A Jet \footnote{By Jet we mean QCD Jet.}is an artifact of all the high energy collider physics experiments, it's a collimated spray of particles in a given direction which can all be traced back to a common vetrex. These particles result from hadronization of a quark therefore they also share the energy and momenta of the original quark. In the experiments these particles show up as a set of hadrons and photons which are concentrated within some annular region of the detector. There is no universally accepted definition of a jet however the most natural definition is based on a cone radius in pseudorapidity-azimuth plane within which most of these particles are contained. 
	
	A jet algorithm operates on the four momenta of the final state particles or some detector quantities like the energy deposits in calorimeters, these quantities are referred to as 'contituents'of the jet. A jet algorithm clusters two consituents i and j into one new constituent if the quantity $\Delta d_{ij}$ which is related to the angular separation $\Delta R_{ij}$ between the  between them, satisfies the condition $d_{ij} < R$, i.e. if they are closer than R in some distance measure. Clustering is done recursively untill there are no clusters left within R distance from one another. For our analysis we use sequantial anti-$k_T$ and Cambridge/Aachen(C/A) algorithms which differ only in the choice of the distance parameter $d_{ij}$ \footnote{ $d_{ij} = \Delta R_{ij}$ for C/A and $d_{ij} = min \left( \frac{1}{p_T^i}, \frac{1}{p_T^j} \right)\times \Delta R_{ij}  $ for anti-$k_T$. The two consituents i,j are clustered together if $d_{ij} < R$.}.  
	
	
	  
	 


 A jet algorithm tries to findthe original parton momentum by iteratively combining the momenta of nearby partons and inthat sense reverse the parton splitting.

	used for reconstruction of hadronically decaying top in our analysis. A comparision between then made based on  


In this study top reconstruction is performed in the process where a massive Z0 boson decays to two
boosted top quarks, one of which decays hadronically and the other leptonically. Three cases corre-
sponding to Z0 mass of 500,1000,2000 GeV are considered, and performances of different top taggin
algorithms are compared for the three cases. PYTHIA8 is used for event generation, FASTJET3
package is used for jet reconstruction and ROOT6 for data analysis and visualization.

We have generated 500000 events of the type $Z^\prime \to t \bar{t}$ for the three Z‘ masses mentioned above.
Top quarks are forced to decay to W boson and b quark. Both the W particles can then decay
either hadronically or leptonically. We are interested in events in which one of the W particle decays
hadronically and other leptonically, such that final state contains one lepton and 4 quarks. Events
with p lepton
> 20 GeV are stored for analysis. Following plots show some of the kinematic properties
T
of the particles in our events of interest.

We also look at dominant background for this process, which is QCD.  Current LHC energy $\sqrt{s} = 14$ is assumed.

expected to be greater than 209 GeV .


  All currentZ′analyses at the LHC are however guided by non-supersymmetric considerations in whichtheZ′boson only decays into SM particles  

Z′bosons with couplings to quarks maybe produced at hadron colliders in the s-channel and would show up as resonances in the invariant mass distribution of the decay product
 

with  the  same  couplings  as  the  SMZ0but a much higher polemass (on the order of TeV).
